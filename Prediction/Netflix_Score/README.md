# Netflix Movie Review project
This project trains ability to use explanatory and predictive analysis. I am tasked with working on the ‘Netflix’ dataset. Netflix is an online movie streaming service. Their customers watching movies, and subsequently rate them. Netflix uses these ratings to inform other recommendations. We are going to focus on the first 5 Rocky movies, starring Sylvester Stallone as a boxer who fights to overcome the odds. I predict how highly a consumer will rate Rocky 5 given the ratings of the previous 4 films. I will also have to contend with missing values.
