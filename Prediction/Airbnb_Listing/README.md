# Lessons-from-Airbnb-in-Boston

In this project,I combine your data mining skills to answer some questions about the relationships between the Airbnb rental properties and the neighborhoods in the City of Boston.  The project requires the entire process of a data mining project:  data wrangling, dimension reduction, creative thinking, supervised and unsupervised learning, visualization, and coherent reporting.
